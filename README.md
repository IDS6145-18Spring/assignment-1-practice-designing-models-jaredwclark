# Assignment1 - Practice Designing Models (Template)
(remove: **text between brackets to be removed**)

> * Participant name: Jared Clark
> * Project Title: Safe Pedestrian Traffic System - SafeX (Safe Crosswalks)

## General Introduction

A **smart city** is an urban area that uses different types of electronic data collection sensors to supply information which is used to manage assets and resources efficiently.

(remove: States your motivation clearly: why is it important / interesting to solve this problem?)
(remove: Add real-world examples, if any)
(remove: Put the problem into a historical context, from what does it originate? Are there already some proposed solutions?)

## Requirements (Experimental Design)

SafeX system will set the following requirements:
* 50% reduction in pedestrian and bicycle incidents overall
* 80% reduction in pedestrian and bicycle fatalities overall
* 50% reduction in pedestrian and bicycle incidents involving citizens with disabilities (hearing, vision, cognitive, and mobility issues)
* 10% or less of total system alerts are false positives


## Smart City (My Problem) Model

(remove: add a high-level overview of your model, the part below should link to the model directory markdown files)
(remove: Look at the [**Object Diagram**](model/object_diagram.md) for how to structure this part of Part 2 for each diagram. Only the Object diagram has the template, the rest are blank. )

* [**Object Diagram**](model/object_diagram.md) - provides the high level overview of components
* [**Class Diagram**](model/class_diagram.md) - provides details of (what are you providing details of)
* [**Behavior Diagram**](model/behavior_diagram.md) - provides details of (what are you providing details of)
* [**Agent / User case** (if appropriate)](model/agent_usecase_diagram.md) - provides details of (what are you providing details of)

## Smart City (My Problem) Simulation

(remove: for part 3 add two to three sentences here and link the [**(your own name)**](model/README.md) file in the analysis folder - which describe how you would simulate this - type of simulation, rough details -inputs, outputs - how it will help you analyze your experimental hypothesis, or nullify your null hypothesis.)

## **P**ortable **O**rganic **T**rouble-free **S**elf-watering System (**POTS**) Model
Here [**we provide an overview**](code/POTS_system/README.md) of the **P**ortable **O**rganic **T**rouble-free **S**elf-watering System (**POTS**) Model and provide a source code template.
