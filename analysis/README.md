## Smart City Safe Pedestrian Traffic System Simulation

A continuous simulation will be used to address the Safe Pedestrian Traffic System needs. 

A continuous simulation will help identify parameters of the traffic system. Vehicle, pedestrian, and biker throughput can be identified as well as the number of sensors (optical, pressure, and sound) needed to handle the throughput. 

Using historical traffic data the simulation will assist in determining if the appropriate number and location of sensors are in place. Too many could be expensive and become cumbersome for citizens. Too few and the systems goals could not be acheieved.
